# PANDAmonium Components Board
The PANDAmonium Components board is a panda themed macropad design by me (kai pereira);

It's a simple 3x3 keyboard layout with some fun LED's and silly design.

## What I want to use it for
I want to use my macropad to potentially make some complicated VIM motions like search and replace or smth and maybe for optimizing the browser experience.
